Instructions for the Data Science Exercise Sessions

The very first step is find somebody to work with and sit down together. The two of you will be working together on these exercises.  These have been designed to work best two two people (or occasionally three), not with one!

To start the exercises, open the [instructions on GitHub](https://github.com/bobjacobsen/csc-exercises/blob/master/DataScience/README.md) file in your favorite web browser and follow those instructions.

Please read that index page's instructions all the way through.  We've put some general info at the top that you should know, and put some reference links at the bottom that you might later discover you need.
